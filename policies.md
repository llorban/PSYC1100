## Accessibility

Kwantlen accommodates students with disabilities who have registered with the Disability Resource Centre. Kwantlen accommodates students whose religious obligations conflict with attendance, submitting assignments, or completing scheduled tests and examinations. Please let your instructor know in advance, preferably in the first week of class, if you will require any accommodation on these grounds.

## Missing Exams

The only exceptions to missing an exam are medical excuses.

Three criteria must be met:

You must notify Dr. Orban before the exam. This may be as little as 5 minutes before the exam, and may be completed by email.
You must present a medical note within 7 days of missing the exam. The medical note may be scanned and emailed if a meeting with Dr. Orban cannot be arranged.
The make-up must be written within one week of the last day the medical note covers.

If any one of these conditions are not met, a make-up exam cannot be written.
